The ISO standards for Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP) provide an internationally accepted framework to uniquely identify and describe medicinal products. Driven by regulatory requirements, the role of IDMP is to align the pharmaceutical industry on data standards around product and substance information. Realization of the full potential of IDMP depends on self-describing data to counteract diverse, non-standard IDMP implementations. 

For this purpose, we will augment the existing IDMP standardization efforts with an IDMP Ontology that enables deep, semantic interoperability based on FAIR principles. This will ultimately enable entirely new ways of collaboration and enable early adopters to gain a competitive advantage in innovation, drug safety and overall operational efficiency. IDMP Ontology suite is meant to become a digital standard to create interoperability by design. We "ontologize" the ISO IDMP Logical Model to augment IDMP with a digital standard based on FAIR principles.

The scope of this project includes the following [ISO](https://www.iso.org/) standards:
1. ISO-11238
1. ISO-11239
1. ISO-11440
1. ISO-11615
1. ISO-11616

The final deliverable will provide a solution agnotistic technology for the data fabric system across various environments that handle the biomedical data.
